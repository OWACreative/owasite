With more than a hundred years of history, Yacht Club Uruguay maintains until today its legitimacy as the institution destined to promote yachting and good sailing practices. Through all these years, the club has been modernized, without ceasing to communicate the yesteryear sailors’ spirit.

The designed monogram's elliptical composition was generated based on a series of concentric circles, which represent the sailing radar’s contour shape on the captain’s screen. An elegant yet simple typography, referring to the universal aesthetic of yachting, completes the isologotype. The color palette reflects the Uruguayan flag colors and also the contrast of the sun and the sea, both essential elements in sailing.
